# Lvalue vs Rvalue References

1. **Lvalue**:
   - An lvalue refers to an object that has a persistent address in memory, which means it can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.
   - Example: 
     ```cpp
     int x = 5;  // 'x' is an lvalue, it has a memory location.
     x = 10;  // Valid, as lvalues can be reassigned.
     ```

2. **Rvalue**:
   - An rvalue is a temporary object that does not have a persistent memory location. It typically appears on the right-hand side of an assignment.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int y = 10 + 5;  // '10 + 5' is an rvalue, it's a temporary result.
     ```
   - **Rvalues** cannot appear on the left-hand side of an assignment:
     ```cpp
     10 = y;  // Invalid, 10 is an rvalue.
     ```

### **Lvalue References (`&`)**:
- A reference to an lvalue binds to a memory location. This is why you can pass an lvalue by reference to a function using `&`:
  ```cpp
  void foo(int &x) {
      x = 10;  // Valid, x is an lvalue reference.
  }
  
  int a = 5;
  foo(a);  // Works, 'a' is an lvalue.
  ```

### **Rvalue References (`&&`)**:
- Rvalue references allow you to bind to **temporary objects** (rvalues). They are introduced in C++11 to support **move semantics**.
- **Rvalue references** are useful when you want to take ownership of resources from temporary objects, avoiding unnecessary copying.
  ```cpp
  void foo(int &&x) {
      // 'x' is an rvalue reference, meaning it binds to a temporary value.
      x = 10;  // Valid, x is mutable, but it's a temporary.
  }

  foo(5);  // Valid, 5 is an rvalue.
  ```

### **Move Semantics and Move Constructor:**
The **move constructor** and **move assignment operator** allow you to "move" resources (like heap memory) from one object to another, instead of copying them. This is more efficient for temporary objects or objects you no longer need.

### Code:

1. **Move Constructor**:
   In your example, you incorrectly use `Test(const Test &&obj)` instead of `Test(Test &&obj)` (no need for `const` in a move constructor). Also, in the move constructor, you shouldn't set `obj = NULL;` because you can't modify `obj` itself (it is an rvalue). Instead, you should set `obj.p = nullptr`.

2. **Move Assignment Operator**:
   Similarly, in your move assignment operator, you should use `obj.p = nullptr;` to indicate that the resource has been moved from `obj`.

Here’s the corrected version of your class with a proper move constructor and move assignment operator:

### **Corrected Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Test {
public:
    int *p;

    // Default constructor
    Test() { p = new int(5); }

    // Copy constructor (deep copy)
    Test(const Test &obj) {
        p = new int;
        *p = *obj.p;
    }

    // Copy assignment operator (deep copy)
    Test& operator=(const Test &obj) {
        if (this != &obj) {
            delete p;
            p = new int(*obj.p);  // Allocate new memory and copy
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move constructor (rvalue reference)
    Test(Test &&obj) noexcept {
        p = obj.p;          // Take ownership of the resource
        obj.p = nullptr;    // Set source object's pointer to nullptr
    }

    // Move assignment operator (rvalue reference)
    Test& operator=(Test &&obj) noexcept {
        if (this != &obj) {
            delete p;       // Free existing resource
            p = obj.p;      // Take ownership of the resource
            obj.p = nullptr;  // Set source object's pointer to nullptr
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Test() {
        delete p;  // Clean up memory
    }
};

int main() {
    Test obj1;
    Test obj2(obj1);  // Copy constructor (deep copy)

    Test obj3 = Test();  // Move constructor
    obj3 = Test();  // Move assignment operator

    std::cout << *obj1.p << std::endl;
    std::cout << *obj2.p << std::endl;
    std::cout << *obj3.p << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Move Constructor**: The move constructor transfers ownership of the resource (like dynamically allocated memory) from the source object to the new object.
- **Move Assignment Operator**: Similar to the move constructor, but works during assignment (i.e., after the object is already initialized).
- **Setting `obj.p = nullptr;`**: This marks that the source object no longer owns the resource, so its destructor won't try to delete the resource.

### Differences Between Lvalue and Rvalue:
- **Lvalues** persist and can be referenced (have memory), while **rvalues** are temporary and don’t occupy memory locations that can be referenced.
- **Lvalue references** bind to lvalues, while **rvalue references** bind to rvalues, allowing you to transfer ownership of resources efficiently.

### Usage in Move Semantics:
Move semantics comes into play when working with rvalues, allowing efficient transfer of resources instead of copying. This is particularly useful in situations where objects manage resources like dynamically allocated memory or file handles, where copying can be expensive.
